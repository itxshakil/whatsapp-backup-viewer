### 🛡️ Your Privacy, Guaranteed
Most "chat viewers" require you to upload your personal data to their servers. **We don't.**
- **100% Local Processing**: Your chats are parsed and rendered entirely within your browser.
- **No Data Collection**: We don't track you, we don't save your messages, and we never see your data.
- **Secure Storage**: If you choose to save a chat for later, it stays in your browser's secure local database (IndexedDB).
